Flashcard 5:
Q: Which amino acids are considered hydrophobic?
A: Alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan are examples of hydrophobic amino acids.

Flashcard 6:
Q: What are hydrophilic amino acids?
A: Hydrophilic amino acids include serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, and the charged amino acids like lysine and aspartic acid.

Flashcard 7:
Q: What type of bond forms between two cysteine residues?
A: A disulfide bond (linkage) forms between the thiol groups of two cysteine residues.

Flashcard 8:
Q: What is the structure of cystine?
A: Cystine is formed when two cysteine molecules are linked by a disulfide bond.

Flashcard 9:
Q: Describe the peptide bond formation.
A: A peptide bond forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing a molecule of water (dehydration synthesis).

Flashcard 10:
Q: What are polypeptides?
A: Polypeptides are chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, typically consisting of 10 or more amino acids.

Flashcard 11:
Q: What defines a protein?
A: A protein is a functional molecule made up of one or more polypeptides that have folded into a specific three-dimensional structure.

Flashcard 12:
Q: What is hydrolysis in the context of proteins?
A: Hydrolysis is the process of breaking peptide bonds in proteins or polypeptides by adding water, resulting in the release of individual amino acids.

Flashcard 13:
Q: What role do amino acids play in enzyme function?
A: Amino acids are the building blocks of enzymes, and their specific sequences determine the enzyme's activity and specificity.

Flashcard 14:
Q: Which amino acid contains sulfur in its side chain?
A: Cysteine contains sulfur in its side chain, allowing for disulfide bond formation.

Flashcard 15:
Q: How do hydrophobic interactions affect protein structure?
A: Hydrophobic interactions drive nonpolar side chains to the interior of proteins, stabilizing the three-dimensional structure.

Flashcard 16:
Q: What is the significance of the primary structure of proteins?
A: The primary structure is the specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, which determines all higher levels of protein structure.

Flashcard 17:
Q: How does pH affect the charge of amino acids?
A: The charge of amino acids varies with pH; low pH (acidic) can protonate amino groups, while high pH (basic) can deprotonate carboxyl groups.

Flashcard 18:
Q: What type of reaction occurs when two amino acids form a dipeptide?
A: A dehydration synthesis (condensation) reaction occurs, releasing water.

Flashcard 19:
Q: Which amino acid can form a ring structure and is often involved in protein structure?
A: Proline can form a ring structure due to its unique side chain, which connects back to the amino group.

Flashcard 20:
Q: What is the role of polar amino acids in protein function?
A: Polar amino acids can form hydrogen bonds and interact with the aqueous environment, playing key roles in enzyme active sites and protein solubility."
2,Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems:,Structure and function of proteins and their constituent amino acids,"Q: What is the primary structure of a protein?
A: The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
Q: What type of bonding primarily stabilizes the secondary structure of proteins?
A: Hydrogen bonds between the backbone amine and carbonyl groups stabilize the secondary structure.
Q: Name two common types of secondary structures in proteins.
A: Alpha helices and beta sheets.
Q: What is tertiary structure in proteins?
A: The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional shape formed by the folding of a polypeptide chain due to interactions between side chains.
Q: How does proline affect protein structure?
A: Proline introduces kinks in the polypeptide chain, limiting the flexibility of the backbone and often disrupting alpha helices.
Q: What is the role of cysteine in protein structure?
A: Cysteine can form disulfide bridges (covalent bonds) that stabilize the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins.
Q: What are hydrophobic interactions, and why are they important in protein folding?
A: Hydrophobic interactions occur when nonpolar side chains cluster together, minimizing their exposure to water, which drives the folding process.
Q: Define quaternary structure in proteins.
A: The quaternary structure refers to the assembly of multiple polypeptide chains into a functional protein complex.
Q: What is denaturation of proteins?
A: Denaturation is the process where a protein loses its native structure due to the disruption of non-covalent interactions, often resulting in loss of function.
Q: How does entropy relate to the solvation layer of proteins?
A: The formation of a solvation layer increases local entropy as water molecules surrounding hydrophobic regions are released, favoring protein folding.
Q: What is the isoelectric point (pI) of a protein?
A: The isoelectric point is the pH at which a protein has no net charge, leading to minimal solubility.
Q: Describe the principle behind electrophoresis.
A: Electrophoresis separates proteins based on their size and charge by applying an electric field to a gel matrix.
Q: What role do chaperone proteins play in protein folding?
A: Chaperones assist in the proper folding of proteins, preventing aggregation and misfolding.
Q: What is the difference between native and denatured protein?
A: Native proteins have a specific functional three-dimensional structure, while denatured proteins have lost their structural integrity and function.
Q: What technique would you use to separate proteins based on size?
A: Size-exclusion chromatography or SDS-PAGE.
Q: How do hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids influence protein structure?
A: Hydrophilic amino acids tend to be on the surface, while hydrophobic amino acids are often buried in the interior, affecting the overall folding.
Q: What factors can lead to protein denaturation?
A: Changes in pH, temperature, and the presence of chemicals (like urea or detergents) can lead to denaturation.
Q: What is the significance of the Ramachandran plot?
A: The Ramachandran plot illustrates the allowed and disallowed dihedral angles of amino acid residues in a polypeptide.
Q: Explain the term ""molecular chaperones.""
A: Molecular chaperones are proteins that assist in the proper folding of other proteins and prevent aggregation.
Q: How does the concentration of ions affect the isoelectric point of a protein?
A: The presence of ions can shield charges on the protein, potentially altering its effective pKa values and thus affecting the isoelectric point."
