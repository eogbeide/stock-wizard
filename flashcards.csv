A: The contractile ring, formed by microfilaments, constricts to separate the daughter cells during cytokinesis, completing cell division.

Flashcard 24:
Q: How do cells utilize the cytoskeleton for shape changes?
A: The cytoskeleton facilitates shape changes through polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments and microtubules, allowing for processes like cell migration and division.

Flashcard 25:
Q: What is the significance of ciliary signaling in development?
A: Cilia play crucial roles in developmental signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog signaling, impacting cell fate and tissue patterning during embryogenesis."

Q: What are the primary functions of epithelial tissue?
A: Epithelial tissue functions in protection, absorption, secretion, and sensation, serving as a barrier between internal and external environments.

Flashcard 2:
Q: Describe the structural characteristics of epithelial cells.
A: Epithelial cells are closely packed, have minimal extracellular matrix, possess polarity (apical and basal surfaces), and are anchored to the basement membrane.

Flashcard 3:
Q: What are the different classifications of epithelial tissue based on cell shape?
A: Epithelial tissue can be classified as squamous (flat), cuboidal (cube-shaped), or columnar (tall and column-like).

Flashcard 4:
Q: How are epithelial tissues classified based on the number of cell layers?
A: Epithelial tissues are classified as simple (single layer) or stratified (multiple layers), with pseudostratified epithelium appearing layered but is actually a single layer.

Flashcard 5:
Q: What is the function of ciliated epithelium, and where is it commonly found?
A: Ciliated epithelium helps move mucus and particles; it is commonly found in the respiratory tract and fallopian tubes.

Flashcard 6:
Q: How do epithelial cells receive nutrients?
A: Epithelial cells receive nutrients through diffusion from underlying connective tissue since they are avascular (lack blood vessels).

Flashcard 7:
Q: What is the role of tight junctions in epithelial tissue?
A: Tight junctions prevent the passage of substances between epithelial cells, ensuring that materials must pass through the cells (transcellular transport).
