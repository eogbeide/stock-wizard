1,Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems:,Structure and function of proteins and their constituent amino acids,"Flashcard 1:
Q: What is the absolute configuration of amino acids at the ? position?
A: Most amino acids are in the L configuration, except for glycine, which is achiral.

Flashcard 2:
Q: How do amino acids exist in solution at physiological pH?
A: Amino acids exist as dipolar ions (zwitterions), with a positively charged amino group and a negatively charged carboxyl group.

Flashcard 3:
Q: Which amino acids are classified as acidic?
A: Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are classified as acidic due to their carboxylic acid side chains.

Flashcard 4:
Q: Name two basic amino acids.
A: Lysine and arginine are classified as basic due to their positively charged side chains at physiological pH.

Flashcard 5:
Q: Which amino acids are considered hydrophobic?
A: Alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan are examples of hydrophobic amino acids.

Flashcard 6:
Q: What are hydrophilic amino acids?
A: Hydrophilic amino acids include serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, and the charged amino acids like lysine and aspartic acid.

Flashcard 7:
Q: What type of bond forms between two cysteine residues?
A: A disulfide bond (linkage) forms between the thiol groups of two cysteine residues.

Flashcard 8:
Q: What is the structure of cystine?
A: Cystine is formed when two cysteine molecules are linked by a disulfide bond.

Flashcard 9:
Q: Describe the peptide bond formation.
A: A peptide bond forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing a molecule of water (dehydration synthesis).

Flashcard 10:
Q: What are polypeptides?
A: Polypeptides are chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, typically consisting of 10 or more amino acids.

Flashcard 11:
Q: What defines a protein?
A: A protein is a functional molecule made up of one or more polypeptides that have folded into a specific three-dimensional structure.

Flashcard 12:
Q: What is hydrolysis in the context of proteins?
A: Hydrolysis is the process of breaking peptide bonds in proteins or polypeptides by adding water, resulting in the release of individual amino acids.

Flashcard 13:
Q: What role do amino acids play in enzyme function?
A: Amino acids are the building blocks of enzymes, and their specific sequences determine the enzyme's activity and specificity.

Flashcard 14:
Q: Which amino acid contains sulfur in its side chain?
A: Cysteine contains sulfur in its side chain, allowing for disulfide bond formation.

Flashcard 15:
Q: How do hydrophobic interactions affect protein structure?
A: Hydrophobic interactions drive nonpolar side chains to the interior of proteins, stabilizing the three-dimensional structure.

Flashcard 16:
Q: What is the significance of the primary structure of proteins?
A: The primary structure is the specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, which determines all higher levels of protein structure.

Flashcard 17:
Q: How does pH affect the charge of amino acids?
A: The charge of amino acids varies with pH; low pH (acidic) can protonate amino groups, while high pH (basic) can deprotonate carboxyl groups.

Flashcard 18:
Q: What type of reaction occurs when two amino acids form a dipeptide?
A: A dehydration synthesis (condensation) reaction occurs, releasing water.

Flashcard 19:
Q: Which amino acid can form a ring structure and is often involved in protein structure?
A: Proline can form a ring structure due to its unique side chain, which connects back to the amino group.

Flashcard 20:
Q: What is the role of polar amino acids in protein function?
A: Polar amino acids can form hydrogen bonds and interact with the aqueous environment, playing key roles in enzyme active sites and protein solubility."
